the Licensing Terms and Conditions for AR Services (AR LTCs). The Ministry may on an 
exceptional basis allow importation of the embryos, subject to conditions. These conditions 
include: (a) declaration by the overseas AR centre that the relevant requirements under the AR 
LTCs, including the handling, processing and storage of the embryos, are adhered to; (b) that 
no other findings besides the presence or absence of chromosomal aberrations are reported, and 
(c) proper documentation of the screening test results that were provided to the patient and 
attending physician in our local AR centres.&nbsp;</p><p>Local AR centres which receive the 
tested embryos must also continue to ensure compliance with the AR LTCs.</p>"""
