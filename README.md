## Sentiment Analysis

Uses pretrained
[`textattack/bert-base-uncased-SST-2`](https://huggingface.co/textattack/bert-base-uncased-SST-2)

Expected negative sentiment

> Sir, I am proud that the Malay/Muslim community here remains strong and
> united despite many tests and challenges. It just that lately, some members of the community
> and our asatizah have complained that when crucial issues are voiced out or problems are
> raised, there are no clear answers from the authorities responsible for managing our welfare,
> needs and well-being.

```Negative: 0.8860296607017517, Positive: 0.11397039145231247```

---

Expected positive sentiment

> The difficult adjustments made by the community in response to COVID-19s
> was possible because our religious leadership was decisive and united. MUIS played a central
> role in this by issuing religious guidance early and rallying asatizah and mosque leaders to
> guide the community to adapt to the changing environment. While MUIS was monitoring
> developments and decisions of religious authorities around the world, we could not simply
> copy what others had done, but rather had to find our own solutions. When difficult decisions
> were made, the community came together and supported these decisions. Everyone played a part
> to encourage and guide one another â€“ lawyers, doctors, community leaders and ordinary citizens,
> all rolled up our sleeves.

```Negative: 0.0032350728288292885, Positive: 0.9967648983001709```

---

Unclear example, negative topic but neutral sentiment

> One of the concerns I have relates to the guidance of high-risk Malay/Muslim
> youths who often come from families with many issues. They may have insufficient role models at
> home for a variety of reasons. It is not uncommon for such youths to suffer low confidence, poor
> performance in studies, or be involved in activities that may lead them down the road of
> juvenile delinquency.

```Negative: 0.983299970626831, Positive: 0.01669997349381447```

Unclear example, positive topic but possible negative sentiment

> Earlier this year, MCCY had organised "Emerging Stronger Together" and
> "Ciptasama" sessions for the Malay/Muslim community to share their views and suggestions
> in building a community of success and a better Singapore for the future. I note from the
> "Emerging Stronger" website that only 6% of the participants in these conversations were
> Malay. And I hope that more in our community can participate

```Negative: 0.042257506400346756, Positive: 0.9577425122261047```

### Input

> Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health
> whether couples who have pre-implantation genetically screened embryos stored overseas can have
> their embryos shipped to Singapore given current travel restrictions during the
> pandemic. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health
> (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health): Happy International Women's
> Day to all! During the pandemic, MOH received appeals from some couples to import their
> pre-implantation genetically screened embryos stored overseas. In reviewing
> each appeal, the Ministry considered whether processes and standards employed by overseas
> assisted reproduction (AR) centres are aligned to Singaporeâ€™s regulatory requirements under
> the Licensing Terms and Conditions for AR Services (AR LTCs). The Ministry may on an
> exceptional basis allow importation of the embryos, subject to conditions. These conditions
> include: (a) declaration by the overseas AR centre that the relevant requirements under the AR
> LTCs, including the handling, processing and storage of the embryos, are adhered to; (b) that
> no other findings besides the presence or absence of chromosomal aberrations are reported, and
> (c) proper documentation of the screening test results that were provided to the patient and
> attending physician in our local AR centres. Local AR centres which receive the
> tested embryos must also continue to ensure compliance with the AR LTCs.

### Output
> During the pandemic, MOH received appeals from some couples to import their pre-implantation
> genetically screened embryos stored overseas. The Ministry may on exceptional basis allow
> importation of the embryos, subject to conditions.
